### The Objective

The idea behind Fastroute is to make an app that recommends the best route between point destinations that an end-user is hoping to cover via a drive over a short period of time (let's say, a few hours). Think about when you go shopping around on craigslist for local garagle sales and you have a couple of stops you'd like to check out. This exact scenario plays out daily/weekly in my life and so I brought Fastroute to Apples' distribution platform. It does nothing more, nothing less.

### Migrating from Objective-C to Swift

Shortly after I launched my first Objective-C app on the Appstore, Swift was introduced by Apple in 2015. It's possible to bridge between Objective-C (created 30 years ago) and Swift and that backward compatibility shows us the true creative awesomeness of the language designers. Swift, however, as a new language is an evolutionary step above Objective-C in part to:

> Reduced runtime errors due to proper null checks

> Less code that needs to be written leading to developer productivity

> Less time focusing on memory management with ARC support

> Faster execution performance and leaner compiler (think C++)

### How long did it take to build?

> 1 month and I think it's due in part to the language itself and of course my strong desire to get some solution out there for a problem I faced.
